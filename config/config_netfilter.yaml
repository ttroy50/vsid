    # The size of the netfilter netlink userland queue
    # Size is set using nfnl_rcvbufsiz and caluclated by NfQueueSize * NfBufSize

    # This is also the size of packets set as expected to receive from nfqueue

    # Number of worker threads to use in the Flow Manager.

    # This controls whether the NfQueue verdict is set by the flow manager or the packet handler.
    # If true, the FlowManager / Flow will set the verdict. Which will be when it has processed the packet.
    #   This can allow drop packets if it fails to put the packet into the processing queue
    # If false, the packet is always set ot accept by the PacketHandler after the return from FlowManager::addPacket
    #   The exact timing will depend on if you are using worker threads.
    #   With no threads it will be after classificaton
    #   With threads it will be after putting it into the thread queue
